 # Minecraft-Wonder-Like-Standees
 Mario Wonder like revival!
 
 **This aims to replicate the revival system that comes from Super Mario Bros: Wonder!**
 On Death. You will turn into a ghost at the place of your death with a few seconds to get revived.
 The duration is 15 seconds on death instead of the 5 seconds due to the more open-space that Minecraft is to either go to a standee (Armour Stand) or an alive player to be revived!
 If the duration runs out. You will respawn at your spawnpoint.
